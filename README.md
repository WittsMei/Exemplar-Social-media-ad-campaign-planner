Compare the exemplar to your completed social media ad campaign planner. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

Your campaign planner should include the following components:

#### An objective that describes the purpose of the campaign: driving traffic to the company’s website

- **A description** of the campaign’s target audience, based on the customer persona, that includes demographic information (such as gender, age range, and location) and any other important information (such as keywords, education, and interests)

- **A social media platform** that serves the objective your campaign and reaches your audience, such as Facebook, since it is ideal for driving website traffic

- **An ad format** that helps achieve the objective of your campaign, like a static image, since it can help the audience visualize using the product and include a call to action  button

- **A description** of the ad’s creatives, including visual assets and text, that addresses the audience’s demographics, goal, and barriers

- **A call to action** that relates to the campaign’s objective and is clear, uses action words, and is brief—no more than five to seven words
